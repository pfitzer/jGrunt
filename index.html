<h1>Welcome to jGrunt</h1>

<p>Why using grunt-init with jGrunt to generate a base Joomla component?</p>
<p>The answer is simple - spend less time on configuration and more time on programming. jGrunt enables
you to generate a base Joomla component in seconds. It create the hole structure of a Joomla component
with views, controllers and models. jGrunt asks you for some parameters like component name, license, repository url
and so on, the rest is just magic.</p>

<h2>Generation</h2>
<p>Here you can see which files are generated.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
mpfister ~/Scripte/jgrunt-test $ grunt-init jGrunt
Running "init:jGrunt" (init) task
This task will create one or more files in the current directory, based on the
environment and the answers to a few questions. Note that answering "?" to any
question will show question-specific help and answering "none" to most questions
will leave its value blank.
